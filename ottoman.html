    <h3>Ottoman Expansion and Rule</h3>
    <p>The Ottoman Empire was One of the Oldest Empires at the time of colonialism. Spanning nearly 600 years the
        Ottoman Empire Had lots of land under its control during its peak. While they never spread overseas with
        colonial holdings they did controll the middle east, north africa, the balkans and eastern europe at their peak.
        The Ottomans Were Known for being quite brutal to their enemies but as the years went on they refused to
        modernize in beurocracy and military might ad fell massively behind loosing land and influence. They began to be
        ridiculed by the other great powers coming to be known as the "Sick Man" of europe as they went on the decline
        for a long time. despite this there were some within the empire that refused to go without a fight.
