    <h3>French Expansion and Rule</h3>
    <p>The French Empire has been in conflict with the Brittish Empire as well as many other European powers for
        centuries and has seen many rises and declines. starting as early as 1605 the French were one of the first to
        consolidate power and form a true empire on the european continent. the French Empire held some minor colonial
        holdings in the americas and india up until the early 1800's when the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars
        bankrupt France causing them to have to sell their holdings and start from square one. After the end of the
        Napoleonic wars some minor holdings were restored to Frace and began to rebuild its empire conquering Indochina,
        Algeria and Western Africa, and after the First World War Madagascar and Syria. While the French Empire was much
        more exploitative than the British Empire it wasnt entirely parasitic in nature. During the First expansion and
        their american holdings they were much more hands off and more welcoming to the natives and didnt try to expell
        them like the british. Even after their conquering of Algeria it was eventually encorperated into france proper
        allowing citizenship and the ability to vote to those in algeria rather than being just a colonial subject.</p>
