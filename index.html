    <h3>British Expansion and Rule</h3>
    <p>The British Empire was one of the most sucessful in terms of colonial expansion and influence. At its peak the
        British Empire controlled as much as 25% of the earth. They were able to expand as much as they did as fast as
        they did due to their excellant military officers and command, as well having unmatched naval supremacy for
        years. While colonialism was exploitative by its very nature the British did not just suck their colonies dry
        and leave nothing behind. The British were the first world power to abolish slavery and due to their influence
        and power other countries followed suit. The British Empire also brought infrastructure and architechture to
        their colonies that has seldom been matched to date. They spread the Ideas of personal liberties outlined in
        their magna carta as well as sowing the seeds of self determination followed up upon by the United States.</p>
