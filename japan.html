    <h3>Japanese Expansion and Rule</h3>
    <p>Similar to Germany The Japanese Empire had a very short but deep impacting history of expansion and influence.
        They truly began during the Meiji Restoration with the consolidation of power to the emperor and looked outward
        to colonize. Under the guise of freeing asia from european colonizers with their East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere
        actually went out to colonize lands for themselves. The Japanese Were extremely brutal in their rule as the
        viewed themselves as the superior asians and had a strong code of honor and glory and looked heavily down upon
        others who didnt follow.</p>
