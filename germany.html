    <h3>German Expansion and Rule</h3>
    <p>While many other states unified and consolidated their power growing their influence and power germany remained a
        group of loosely confederated states with prussia sitting at the top of them. In 1870 during the Franco-Prussian
        War under Prussia Germany was finally united under the German Empire. Feeling the pressure from the powers
        around them the German Empire began to scramble to attempt to catch up to the other world empires of the time.
        While the prussian army and doctrine was much more advanced compared to the other powers at the time, when
        unified into germany they had a very small navy and no colonial holdings. so they Quickly began to build up to
        atempt to claim their place in the sun. by the end of the german empire they had managed to grab some african
        and east asian colonial holdings, have one of the most impressive armies of the time, and a navy large enough to
        try and rival the great powers.</p>
